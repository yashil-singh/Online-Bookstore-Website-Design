                    <h2>Invisible Man</h2>

                    <p>By Ralph Ellison</p>

                    <h3>NRs. 720</h3>

                    <p>Originally published in 1952 as the first novel by a then unknown author, it remained on the bestseller list for sixteen weeks and established Ralph Ellison as one of the key writers of the century. The book is a passionate and witty tour de force of style, strongly influenced by T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, James Joyce, and Dostoevsky. </p>
